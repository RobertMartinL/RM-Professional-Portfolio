This website serves as a platform to host my (Robert Martin) portfolio. This may be used by possible employers to scout my skill by viewing my past projects and eventually, my resume, once it is complete.

The website is organized into a header with functional navigation bar and title, a billboard image, an about me section, a projects section, and a contact me section.

The languages used to create this site to its current version include HTML and CSS.
